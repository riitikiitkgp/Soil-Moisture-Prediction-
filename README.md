DESCRIPTION

This is a regression problem where we need to predict the moisture of the soil to check if it's wet or dry.

WHAT I HAD DONE

1. Perfromed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the given dataset.
2. It starts with loading the dataset and viewing the top 5 rows.
3. We calculate statistical data in the dataset.
4. Then comes finding correlation between the features and also finding statistical values related to the dataset.
5. Data visualization is done with libraries such as matplotlib.
6. Finally 3 different algorithms are used to find the best algorithm.
7. Also accuracy score of each algorithm is calculated for comparison purpose with other algorithms.

MODELS USED

1. Random Forest Regression
2. Linear Regression
3. Lasso Regression 
4. XGBoost Regression

LIBRARIES NEEDED

1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Scikit-Learn

ACCURACIES

1. Random Forest Regression Score = 0.9543140243865802
2. Linear Regression Score = 0.36945123716579775
3. Lasso Regression Score = 0.000000000000000
4. XGBoost Regression Score = 0.9306574663951472

CONCLUSION

We can conclude that Random Forest Regression gives the most accurate results specifically for this problem statement.
